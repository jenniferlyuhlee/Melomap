# Project Ideas

### Idea 1: Image-Song Exploration App
Overview: App that allows users to upload an image and responds with a list of song recommendations in relation to the image. Leverages AI image recognition technologies to provide a more interesting exploration of music that is visual-based and feels personal.

Potential Features:
- Users can share their results with other users and discover even more music 
- Users can add songs results directly to their spotify playlists

APIs:
- AI image keyword generator (grab search terms), potential one's I found:
	- https://labs.everypixel.com/keywording?ref=apilist.fun
   	- https://www.phototag.ai/api
	- https://imagga.com/solutions/auto-tagging

- Spotify API (search tracks, add to playlist)

### Idea 2A: Share Travel Itineraries App
Overview: App that allows users to create and share travel itineraries based on interest tags (shopping, eating, historical sites, etc.). Simplifies travel planning stress by letting users search itineraries that match their traveling style and interests.

Potential Features:
- Users can submit their itineraries and share with others to be favorited
- User profiles displaying interests, visited places, and created/favorited itineraries
- Users can search existing itineraries based on location or interest tags

APIs:
- Google maps (display map)
- Google places (search for places and add to itinerary)
- Google directions optimize routes between spots

### Idea 2B: Share New Spots (simpler to execute than 2A)
Overview: Blog-style app that allows users to share and discover different spots in town based on interest tags (shopping, eating, historical sites, etc.). 

Similar Features and APIs as 2A

### Idea 3: Discover Travel Destinations/Activities
Overview: Create a quiz that asks users questions and provides them with travel recommendations. Helps facilitate new and interesting travel ideas for those who donâ€™t know where to go next. 
	
Potential Features: 
- Favorite/share destinations and activities
- Organize results by city/country

API:
- Amadeus (API with travel-related data)
